\textbf{Abstract}--- When you go to the art museum, you will find out several things to help you see the exhibition better, such as brochure, program books, and audio-guide, etc. For the big size of exhibitions supported by big art gallery or of famous artist, there would be no problem to prepare the goods mentioned before. However, there are a lot of artists who are trying to open an exhibition in small art gallery and students who are preparing the exhibition for the graduation, and they have a lot of problems to possess those kinds of goods.

The purpose of this software project is to help them. We can provide many kinds of IoT services, such as the explanation of the exhibition, explanations of each art, audio-guide, and so on, by using beacon and the mobile application.

\section{  Introduction (Heading 1)}

\noindent 

If you have only a little interest, you will find many art galleries and museums easily. There are over 100 exhibition halls in Seoul, which means that a lot of exhibitions we can enjoy are opening every day. In order to help the audiences enjoy these exhibitions better and feel better, those exhibitions are providing many items that will help people understand the exhibition better. The audiences need to pay extra costs to buy or rent those goods.

\noindent 

However, not all the exhibitions provide those services. In the case of famous artists and big art museums, a lot of people will visit there and see the works, so there will be many people who will pay extra costs to get the chance to inspect better. Therefore, famous artists and big art museums can make extra incomes by making lots of guide goods and sell them.

\noindent On the other hand, let's think about obscure artists and the university students who are preparing the exhibition for the graduations. They can hardly provide those items for their audiences. The first reason is the cost. The cost to make audio guide, brochure, and program books are not low, so the obscure artists and the students cannot afford it.(about 2,000,000 won)

\noindent 

 The second reason is the difference of people's interests. Practically, it is really hard for the small exhibition halls to have people's attention. Even though they spend money more and produce the goods for their exhibitions, there will not be that many people who will pay extra money to buy or rent the goods.

\noindent 

 We thought that people who are trying to open small exhibition and students who are preparing an exhibition doesn't want the extra income but the interests of people. We wanted to provide them more chances for the amateur artists to introduce themselves and to appeal their works to people. Therefore, we want to fulfill their requirements through ``SMART BROCHURE.'' Artists can provide good service to their audiences with less cost, and audiences don't have to pay extra money and get the chance to use many services that artists want to provide, only by installing an application. 

\noindent Though there is a similar application, named ``??????go,'' this service is only for the big exhibitions, so we still need to develop new system.

\section{ Requirements}

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent \textit{2.1. Requirement for The Environment for Using Beacon}

\noindent 

\textit{2.1.1 Bluetooth module}

- Users need to have Bluetooth 4.0 or higher module.



\textit{2.1.2 Smartphone OS}

- ios 7 or higher

- Android 4.3 or Higher



\textit{2.1.3 Mac OS}

- OSX mavericks 10.9

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent \textit{2.2. Requirement for Server}

\noindent 

\noindent \textit{2.2.1 Principal of Beacon communication}

\noindent - The beacon installed in the gallery will send the id code to the smartphone which has the application, and the smartphone will send that id code and the customer information to the server. Lastly, the server will send the appropriate data, which is decided by combining the gallery's information and the customer information, to the smartphone.



\noindent \textit{2.2.2 Back-end server }

\noindent - We need to develop a back-end server that stores the information and judge the id code sent by beacon. For this, we will use Amazon Web Services (AWS).

\noindent 

\noindent \textit{2.2.3 Data uploading}

\noindent - Clients can upload the information data about the exhibition through us. If they send the data to us, we can upload the data to our AWS server. 

\noindent - AWS offers multi-part uploading for minimizing the network delay time.

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent C. Requirement 3 -- User

\noindent 

\noindent - Accuracy : Users want more precise sensor when they use beacon technology

\noindent 

\noindent - Unimportant data : Users don't want information which is not necessary

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent 

\noindent III. Development environment?

\noindent 3.1 Choice of software development platform3.1.1 Which platform and why? (e.g., Windows, Linux, Web, or etc.) - Windows for android application developing- Mac OS for iOS application developing.3.1.2 Which programming language and why?

\noindent - java for android application developing - objective-C and Swift for iOS application developing.- ruby on rails for building AWS server?3.2 Provide a cost estimation for your built. (including any purchase of software/hardware)- cost for server : 1 year for free. And after 1year, there will be additional prices. We predict maybe about 1,000 people will use our service, and DAU(Daily Activity User) will be 300 around. So we will use t1micr instance (AWS), and it's prices are about \$30 per month. So maybe there will be additional \$360 per year.  - cost for beacon : We will use the ``RECO'' beacon. Reco beacon is authorised by iBeacon. It's prices are \ 229,000 (10 pieces). - cost for developer : ?3.3 Provide clear information of your development environment. (e.g., version of software, OS version, your computer resources) 

\noindent - iOS develop 

\noindent   - Mac : OS X Yosemite ver 10.10.1

\noindent   - iOS : iOS 8.3

\noindent 

\noindent - Android develop

\noindent   - Windows : Windows7 ultimate

\noindent   - Android OS : Android 4.4 kitkat

\noindent 

\noindent IV . Using any commercial cloud platform (e.g., Amazon's EC2) is definitely a BONUS. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Software in use ?Any existing software or algorithm in use? (doing a similar task as your proposal; provide a proper reference if there is any) ?There is a little similar software in Korea, ``??????GO'' But this software service is only for big exhibition so small exhibition artist or students can't use that services. 

\item  Task distribution (If you want, you can provide this later at the next phase - design) ?Which member is responsible for what? ?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Specifications 

\noindent For all requirements above, you should provide details of how you can achieve each. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Requirement 1 ?Describe a detailed description of implementation process (e.g., pseudocode level) under your development environment. Any type of graphical representation is also recommended. ?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Requirement2 Like-wise
